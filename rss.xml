            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>'Bike to the Future': Design Museum Gent considers a world of two-wheeled design.</h1><p>'Bike to the Future' is the latest testament to a cycling revolution we've been witnessing since the 1960s. But the Design Museum Gent isn't interested in the past; between 25 March - 23 October it showcases a collection of contemporary models from the new millennium, including Philippe Starck's electric bike 'MASS' or Tobias Knockaert's laser-cut bicycle, and prototypes and experiments for the future, with unusual aesthetics, materials and functions.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e75dd9b06e93c20d73aed8ffe8845b13b5208794.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A Fresh Take On Coffee T-Shirts</h1><p>The coffee shop has always been one of the great incubators for artist-types. It's a home base for creative nomads, where those not shackled to desk jobs go to sketch, write, or just ideate into leather-bound notepads, propped up only by a cup of coffee and, depending on your location and era, a pack of cigarettes.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/99ea5a102a376f1a2a0d9187d3764592ee86f921.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Illustration</h1><p>As part of his Celestial Series, Chicago-based digital artist David Brodeur rendered an alien world filled with berry-like plants, glowing crystals, and candy shaped orbs that sprout from the ground. Despite their exotic designs, Brodeur relies on common colors of familiar fruits to create this Willy Wonka-esque habitat where you can't help but want to reach out and gobble everything up.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4d6c337dd3c98bcadd87c6b27fd94f1493ae65eb.jpg"></article>]]></description>
